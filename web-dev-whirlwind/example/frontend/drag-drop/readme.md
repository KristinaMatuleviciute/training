# drag-drop

This example demonstrates stringing together three modules so that we can drop
an image file into the browser and display an `<img>` tag with the image
contents.

The modules are:

* [drag-and-drop-files](https://npmjs.com/package/drag-and-drop-files)
* [file-reader-stream](https://npmjs.com/package/file-reader-stream)
* [concat-stream](https://npmjs.com/package/concat-stream)
* [path](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html)
