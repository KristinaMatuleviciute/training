# the format

We will have short lectures throughout the day on various topics.

Between the presentations, you the participant should experiment with the topics and
tools covered in the lectures and should think up a new or existing project to
hack on and get help with throughout the day.

I'm here to introduce new ideas and to help you get unstuck!
